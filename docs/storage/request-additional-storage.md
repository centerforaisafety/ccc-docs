## **How to request additional filesystem storage**

By default, all users of the cluster are limited to 500 GB of file system storage on the cluster. If you need more storage for your project, you can submit an [application](https://airtable.com/appeMGyDPWhtwa3Dw/shrJ5x6XnzqGDx3RV) indicating how much additional storage you need and for how long. We are usually able to provide a decision within 2-3 days.
