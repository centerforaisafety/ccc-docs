## **How to share files and directories**
For security measures, if you make your directory readable or executable by other users you will be locked out from being able to `ssh` into the cluster. This prevents other users from manipulating your ssh keys and such. If you do wish to share weâ€™ve made the directories `/data/public_models`, `/data/private_models`, and `/data/datasets`. Useable by everyone and you can share files and folders there.
