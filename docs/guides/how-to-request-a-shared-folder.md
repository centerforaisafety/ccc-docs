## How to request a shared folder
We can set up a folder in the `/private_models` directory for you to share files with your team. To make it easier to keep track of who is using shared folders in `/private_models` and be able to remove files that are no longer in use once projects are finished, we are asking everyone that needs to create a new folder to share files with their team to first fill out this brief [form](https://airtable.com/appeMGyDPWhtwa3Dw/shr0sUqxVLwokliXW). We will then set up the folder and grant access to the relevant team members.

This process does not apply to the `/public_models` folder, which should only be used for models that other teams are likely to want for their research projects.
