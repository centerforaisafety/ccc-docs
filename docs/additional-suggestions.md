# Additional Documentation Suggestions

_These are potential enhancements to improve the overall user experience. They aren’t official docs yet, but serve as ideas:_

1. **Tutorials/How-To Guides**  
   - A “Hello World” ML training tutorial on the cluster.
   - “Migrating from a single-GPU desktop to the cluster.”

2. **Glossary of Terms**  
   - Definitions for “node,” “partition,” “job array,” “RDMA,” etc.

3. **Best Practices Cheat Sheet**  
   - A concise list of do’s and don’ts for quick reference.

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**  
   - More detailed than the FAQ, organized by error types (submission issues, runtime errors, environment conflicts).

5. **Resource Matrix**  
   - A table outlining each SLURM partition, node specs, and maximum run times.

6. **User Contributed Tips**  
   - Possibly a “wiki” or forum for snippets, advanced usage ideas.

7. **API/Tool References**  
   - If the cluster provides custom dashboards or commands, document them.  
   - Link official SLURM references, PyTorch multi-GPU docs, etc.

By continually improving these docs, we help all researchers focus on **AI safety** rather than wrestling with infrastructure!
