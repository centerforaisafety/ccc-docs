# Guides

## **Overview**

The purpose of the Guides section of the documentation is to provide helpful resources for users who are not familiar with how compute clusters work in general and the CAIS compute cluster in particular. We provide resources for various tools and systems used on the cluster, how to use the cluster to do your work, and how to get the most out of the cluster by configuring it to suit your workflow.

The Guides are divided into sections to help you find what you are trying to do.
